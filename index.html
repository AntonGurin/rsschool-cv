      of control systems.</i> The older brother finished <strong>TPU</strong> (Tomsk Polytechnic University), area of specialization management
      in technical systems. So, I had been interested programming and pc's technical aspects from younger years. I loved
      to create a small project in Pascal and successfully took part in the computer science tournaments. <strong>Self-development
