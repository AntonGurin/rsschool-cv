So, I had been interested programming and pc's technical aspects from younger years. I loved to create a small project in Pascal and successfully took part in the computer science tournaments. **_Self-development is the most important thing for me_**. 
It's not only about programming skills. I had been studying a lot of foreign languages kind of **Ukrainian**, **Azerbaijani**, **English**, **French**, **Spanish**

 ### Skills.
 I was no work expirience in IT-companies, *but I have programming experience in different languages in the University*, such as: *C#, C++, C, JavaScript, Python, VBA* (macros in Excel), *SQL*. Also worked with graphic editors (e.g. *Corel Drow*).

 var sum = 0;    
  `for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {    
    if (arr[i] > 0) {                   
      sum += arr[i];`

  return sum;                       
}`
